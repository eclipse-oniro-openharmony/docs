# Customization Capability Overview

Customization capabilities are the capabilities provided by the ArkUI framework for developing and designing UIs. Currently customization of nodes is supported for creating custom nodes. The different control levels of customization capabilities provided by the ArkUI development framework are used for development of applications in different scenarios. The lower the control level of the customization capability, the closer it is to the basic capability, the higher the development flexibility, the higher the development difficulty, and the higher the requirements for the developer's capabilities.

- Custom nodes: Node objects with some basic capabilities of the underlying entity nodes, which can be mixed with native controls through [Custom Placeholder Nodes](./arkts-user-defined-place-hoder.md#custom-placeholder-node). Custom nodes can have the custom capabilities of a single node, such as layout measurement, setting basic attributes, setting event listeners, and custom drawing rendering content. This includes three types of objects: [FrameNode](../reference/apis-arkui/js-apis-arkui-frameNode.md), [RenderNode](../reference/apis-arkui/js-apis-arkui-renderNode.md), and [BuilderNode](../reference/apis-arkui/js-apis-arkui-builderNode.md). FrameNode represents the entity node of the component, RenderNode represents a more lightweight rendering node, and BuilderNode objects provide the ability to create and update native components and component trees.
