# Hardware Compatibility
## Introduction
When you use C or C++ native libraries to develop OpenHarmony applications, hardware matters. OpenHarmony can run on devices of different architectures and from a variety of vendors. It is a great challenge to ensure the compatibility and consistent experience of OpenHarmony applications that use the native libraries.

This section describes the OpenHarmony Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs). It defines the [ABI standards](./ohos-abi.md) supported by OpenHarmony. It also describes how to use the [CPU features](./cpu-features.md) in your applications without compromising compatibility. Finally, it provides an example to demonstrate how to better use [ARM Neon extensions](./neon-guide.md).
