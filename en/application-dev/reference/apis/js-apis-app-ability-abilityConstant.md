# @ohos.app.ability.AbilityConstant (AbilityConstant)

The **AbilityConstant** module defines the ability-related enums, including the initial launch reasons, reasons for the last exit, ability continuation results, and window modes.

> **NOTE**
> 
> The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 9. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version. 
> The APIs of this module can be used only in the stage model.

## Modules to Import

```ts
import AbilityConstant from '@ohos.app.ability.AbilityConstant';
```

## Attributes

## AbilityConstant.LaunchParam

Defines the parameters for starting an ability.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityRuntime.Core

| Name| Type| Readable| Writable| Description|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| launchReason | [LaunchReason](#abilityconstantlaunchreason)| Yes| Yes| Ability launch reason, which is an enumerated type.|
| lastExitReason | [LastExitReason](#abilityconstantlastexitreason) | Yes| Yes| Reason for the last exit, which is an enumerated type.|

## AbilityConstant.LaunchReason

Enumerates the initial ability launch reasons. You can use it together with [onCreate(want, launchParam)](js-apis-app-ability-uiAbility.md#uiabilityoncreate) of [Ability](js-apis-app-ability-uiAbility.md) to complete different operations.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityRuntime.Core

| Name                         | Value  | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| UNKNOWN          | 0    | Unknown reason.|
| START_ABILITY          | 1    | The ability is started by calling [startAbility](js-apis-inner-application-uiAbilityContext.md#uiabilitycontextstartability).|
| CALL | 2    | The ability is started by calling [startAbilityByCall](js-apis-inner-application-uiAbilityContext.md#uiabilitycontextstartabilitybycall).|
| CONTINUATION           | 3    | The ability is started by means of cross-device migration.|
| APP_RECOVERY           | 4    | The ability is automatically started when the application is restored from a fault.|
| SHARE<sup>10+</sup>           | 5    | The ability is started by means of atomic service sharing.|
| AUTO_STARTUP<sup>11+</sup>           | 8    | The ability is automatically started upon system boot.|

**Example**

```ts
import UIAbility from '@ohos.app.ability.UIAbility';
import Want from '@ohos.app.ability.Want';

class MyAbility extends UIAbility {
    onCreate(want: Want, launchParam: AbilityConstant.LaunchParam) {
        if (launchParam.launchReason === AbilityConstant.LaunchReason.START_ABILITY) {
            console.log('The ability has been started by the way of startAbility.');
        }
    }
}
```

## AbilityConstant.LastExitReason

Enumerates the reasons for the last exit. You can use it together with [onCreate(want, launchParam)](js-apis-app-ability-uiAbility.md#uiabilityoncreate) of [Ability](js-apis-app-ability-uiAbility.md) to complete different operations.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityRuntime.Core

| Name                         | Value  | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| UNKNOWN          | 0    | Unknown reason.|
| ABILITY_NOT_RESPONDING | 1    | The ability does not respond. This enum is supported since API version 9 and deprecated since API version 10. You are advised to use **APP_FREEZE**.|
| NORMAL | 2    | The ability exits normally because the user closes the application.|
| CPP_CRASH<sup>10+</sup>  | 3    | The ability exits due to abnormal signals on the local host.|
| JS_ERROR<sup>10+</sup>  | 4    | The ability exits due to a JS_ERROR fault triggered when an application has a JS syntax error that is not captured by developers.|
| APP_FREEZE<sup>10+</sup>  | 5    | The ability exits because watchdog detects that the application is frozen.|
| PERFORMANCE_CONTROL<sup>10+</sup>  | 6    | The ability exits due to system performance problems, for example, insufficient device memory.|
| RESOURCE_CONTROL<sup>10+</sup>  | 7    | The ability exits because the system resource usage (CPU, I/O, or memory usage) exceeds the upper limit.|
| UPGRADE<sup>10+</sup>  | 8    | The ability exits due to an update.|

**Example**

```ts
import UIAbility from '@ohos.app.ability.UIAbility';
import Want from '@ohos.app.ability.Want';

class MyAbility extends UIAbility {
    onCreate(want: Want, launchParam: AbilityConstant.LaunchParam) {
        if (launchParam.lastExitReason === AbilityConstant.LastExitReason.APP_FREEZE) {
            console.log('The ability has exit last because the ability was not responding.');
        }
    }
}
```

## AbilityConstant.OnContinueResult 

Enumerates the ability continuation results. You can use it together with [onContinue(wantParam)](js-apis-app-ability-uiAbility.md#uiabilityoncontinue) of [Ability](js-apis-app-ability-uiAbility.md) to complete different operations.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityRuntime.Core

| Name                         | Value  | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AGREE           | 0    | The ability continuation is accepted.|
| REJECT           | 1    | The ability continuation is rejected. If the application is abnormal in [onContinue](js-apis-app-ability-uiAbility.md#uiabilityoncontinue), which results in abnormal display during data restoration, this error code is returned.|
| MISMATCH  | 2    | The version does not match. The application on the initiator can obtain the version of the target application from [onContinue](js-apis-app-ability-uiAbility.md#uiabilityoncontinue). If the ability continuation cannot be performed due to version mismatch, this error code is returned.|

**Example**

```ts
import UIAbility from '@ohos.app.ability.UIAbility';

class MyAbility extends UIAbility {
    onContinue(wantParam: Record<string, Object>) {
        return AbilityConstant.OnContinueResult.AGREE;
    }
}
```
